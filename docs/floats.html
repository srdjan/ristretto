  <h2>The Ramayana</h2>
  <p>Ravana resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the rakshasa Maricha. Maricha, assuming the
    form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama
    to capture it. Lord Rama chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some time
    Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana
    tries to assure her that Rama is invincible, and that it is best if he continues to follow Rama's orders to
    protect her.</p>

  <p>On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshmana's help. He obeys her
    wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any strangers. He draws a chalk outline
    around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people to
    exit. Finally, with the coast clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality.
    Unaware of the devious plan of her guest, Sita is tricked into leaving the chalk outline and is then forcibly
    carried away by the evil Ravana.</p>

  <p>Ravana carries Sita away to Lanka, where Sita is kept under the heavy guard of rakshasis. Ravana demands Sita
    marry him, but Sita, eternally devoted to Rama, refuses. Rama and Lakshmana learn about Sita's abduction, and
    immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet the demon Kabandha and the ascetic Shabari, who
    direct them towards Sugriva, the monkey king, and Hanuman.</p>

  <p>Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, held prisoner in Lanka, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies
    towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother Vibhishana. The
    monkeys construct a giant floating bridge across the ocean, and the princes and their army cross over to Lanka.
    A lengthy battle ensues, in which Rama eventually kills Ravana.</p>
