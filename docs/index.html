        <h2>The Ramayana</h2>
        <p>Ravana resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the rakshasa Maricha. Maricha, assuming the
          form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama
          to capture it. Lord Rama chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some
          time
          Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana
          tries to assure her that Rama is invincible, and that it is best if he continues to follow Rama's orders to
          protect her.</p>

        <p>On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshmana's help. He obeys her
          wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any strangers. He draws a chalk outline
          around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people
          to
          exit. Finally, with the coast clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality.
          Unaware of the devious plan of her guest, Sita is tricked into leaving the chalk outline and is then forcibly
          carried away by the evil Ravana.</p>
