        <h2>The Ramayana</h2>
        <p>Ravana resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the rakshasa Maricha. Maricha, assuming the
          form of a golden deer, captivates Sita's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, Sita pleads with Rama
          to capture it. Lord Rama chases the deer into the forest, leaving Sita under Lakshmana's guard. After some
          time
          Sita hears Rama calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lakshmana rush to his aid. Lakshmana
          tries to assure her that Rama is invincible, and that it is best if he continues to follow Rama's orders to
          protect her.</p>

        <p>On the verge of hysterics, Sita insists that it is not she but Rama who needs Lakshmana's help. He obeys her
          wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any strangers. He draws a chalk outline
          around the cottage and casts a spell on it that prevents anyone from entering the boundary but allows people
          to
          exit. Finally, with the coast clear, Ravana appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting Sita's hospitality.
          Unaware of the devious plan of her guest, Sita is tricked into leaving the chalk outline and is then forcibly
          carried away by the evil Ravana.</p>

        <h2>Cast of characters</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Rama</dt>
          <dd>One of the protagonists of the tale. Portrayed as the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, he is the eldest
            and
            favorite son of the king of Ayodhya, Dasharatha, and his Queen Kausalya. He is portrayed as the epitome of
            virtue.</dd>

          <dt>Sita</dt>
          <dd>One of the protagonists, the beloved wife of Rama, and the daughter of king Janaka. Rama got the chance to
            marry her by lifting a heavy bow in a competition organized by her father. The competition was to find the
            most suitable husband for Sita, and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the
            avatar
            of goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue.
          </dd>

          <dt>Hanuman</dt>
          <dd>A vanara (a monkeylike being) belonging to the kingdom of Kishkindha. In some versions, he is portrayed as
            the eleventh avatar of god Shiva and an ideal bhakta of Rama. He is born as the son of Kesari, a vanara
            king,
            and the goddess Anjana. He plays an important role in locating Sita and in the ensuing battle.</dd>

          <dt>Lakshmana</dt>
          <dd>A younger brother of Rama, who chose to go into exile with him. He is the son of King Dasaratha and Queen
            Sumitra, and twin of Shatrughna. Lakshmana is portrayed as an avatar of Shesha, the naga (dragon, serpent)
            king associated with the god Vishnu. He spends his time protecting Sita and Rama.</dd>

          <dt>Ravana</dt>
          <dd>A rakshasa, the king of Lanka (current-day Sri Lanka). After performing severe penance for 10,000 years,
            he
            received a boon from the creator-god Brahma: he could henceforth not be killed by gods, demons, or spirits.
            He
            is portrayed as a powerful demon king who disturbs the penances of rishis (ascetics who practice austerities
            in the forest). Vishnu incarnates as the human Rama to defeat him, thus circumventing the boon given by
            Brahma.</dd>

      <h1>Ristretto - test bad for embedding markdown docs</h1>
    
      <p>We believe that a real programmer must understand how a computer works and think like a computer. They should see a problem, not a task. They must be able to analyze and reason at the level of the problem and above, not just at a code level.</p>
      <p>Given how many study materials, courses, and books are available, the main question a beginner faces nowadays is not “where do I study?” but “what should I study and in what order?” There are many opinions on this subject. Some advise starting with mathematics, some advise specific languages and technologies.</p>
      <p>Ristretto is a ready-made path from absolute beginner to your first job.</p>
